## Design üñåÔ∏è

### Theme

During the development of this website, we explored various themes to find the most suitable design. Initially, we adopted a dark blue theme inspired by our first logo. However, this theme did not integrate well with the overall aesthetic of the website, leading to a mix of inconsistent themes. Additionally, the original logo contained excessive detail, which we attempted to simplify, but the results were not convincing.

Therefore, we experimented with several new themes, including a beige color scheme intended to evoke a book-like feel. Unfortunately, this theme did not align with the minimalistic design we aimed for and would require a lot of work to change Mantine's light theme and would go against adviced practices with Mantine. Ultimately, we selected a vibrant blue color that complements our minimalistic design approach. To add visual interest, we incorporated a gradient into the theme.

| <img src="media/OldBookVaultLogo.png" alt="Old logo" width="300" /> | <img src="media/BookVaultLogo.png" alt="New logo" width="300" /> |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                              Old Logo                               |                             New Logo                             |

We also support a light theme and a dark theme. The default theme is based on the user's system preferences, but the user can change the theme manually. Since we support both themes, we have been careful to use colors that work well in both themes and adhere to WCAG guidelines.

### Images üñºÔ∏è

The images used on this website were created using DALL-E 3 and Bing Image Creator. These tools generate images that are not subject to copyright restrictions and can be used freely. Since the generated images were not perfect, we utilized the GIMP image editor to adjust them to better fit our website's design. Additionally, to adhere to sustainable web design principles, we compressed the images using the WebP format, with PNG as a fallback for browsers that do not support WebP. The images for the book covers are from Goodreads, we also use [Placehold.co](https://placehold.co/200x300?text=Cover%20image%20for%20book) for fallbacks.

### Universal Design üåç

### Accessibility ‚ôø

We have made an effort to make our application as accessible as possible.

The Mantine UI library follows the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA) accessibility guidelines. To further increase accessibility, we have added aria-attributes to the relevant components. We also follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure that our website is accessible to all users. The website should be usable to all people, regardless of their abilities.

Examples on accessibility accommodations:

- Sight impaired:
  - Support for screen readers
  - WCAG 2.1 compliant color contrast between text and background
  - Scalable text
  - Website is zoomable
- Hearing:
  - No sound is used to convey information
- Motor impaired:
  - Website is navigable with a keyboard
  - Large clickable areas
- Cognitive:
  - Consistent and intuitive design
  - Clear and concise language

With the use of various developer tools, we have ensured that the website is accessible in various ways.

**Colors** üé®

We have high contrast between text and background to support people who struggle with varying degrees of colorblindness. Mantine uses the [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) color palette, and have set it up such that colors are accessible. We have also made manual adjustments to the Mantine theme, as we found some edge cases where that was not the case. The colors are now WCAG compliant.

## Sustainability üå±

**TODO: Add data and analytics from lighthouse once the application is done**

## Dataset üìö

Read about how we got the dataset [here](./preprocessing/README.md).

## Test coverage üß™

[_This part is partually copied from the first project_](https://git.ntnu.no/IT2810-H24/T05-Project-1/blob/main/README.md)

We use Vitest with Jest for testing.

### Testing in the backend

#### Unit tests

We have unit tests for some of our resolvers. In these tests we check that the resolvers return the correct data, and that they handle errors correctly.

#### Mocking the database

We mock the database when we do tests in the backend. This is mainly done through mocking the methods that query the database, such as `find`, `aggregate`, etc.

### Testing in the frontend

#### Snapshot tests

Snapshot tests are a simple way to ensure no unexpected changes are made to components. We are using snapshot tests for most of our components to ensure that we avoid unexpected changes in the generated HTML.

#### Unit tests

We have unit tests for most of our components. In these tests we check important attributes and functionalities. We however do not test most pages, as the pages mainly just consist of components which are already well tested by unit tests.

#### Mocking the API

We mock the API when we do tests in the frontend. This is mainly done through mocking our hooks as we mainly use hooks to query the API.

#### End-to-end tests &nbsp;<img src="media/CypressLogo.png" alt="Cypress Logo" width="25" />

We are using Cypress to do end-to-end tests. We have followed best practices and have created both small and large tests. The small tests are more focused, e.g. only checking if reviews are working, while the large tests are more comprehensive. We have aimed for 80% smaller feature-focused tests and 20% larger end-to-end tests, both simulate a user's interaction with the application.

The end-to-end tests will test the application as a whole, with the frontend and backend connected. When running these tests you can either choose to run the backend locally or use the backend in the virtual machine. To change this you go to this [env-file](./frontend/.env) and change it to either

- `VITE_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:3001/graphql"` for a local backend.
- `VITE_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="http://it2810-05.idi.ntnu.no/graphql"` for the backend in the virtual machine.

It is best practice to run the E2E on a local test database (or in this course we could use a test database on the VM). However, we know it can take some time to setup a local database if you don't already have MongoDB installed. Therefore we have made it possible to run the tests on the backend in the virtual machine. We have created a predefined test user which you will take control of, when running the E2E tests if you use the virtual machine. In a real-world scenario, we would have not done this and instead used a local test database.

To run the tests you can run the following commands in **separate terminals**:

```
# Do this only if you want to run e2e tests on the local backend. If you want to run the tests on the backend in the virtual machine, skip this step.
# Run the backend (in its own terminal)
cd backend
npm install
npm run start
```

```
# Run the frontend (in its own terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
# Run the e2e tests (in its own terminal)
cd e2e
npm install
npm run cypress
```

After running `npm run cypress` a window should open. You then choose `E2E Testing` and the browser of your choice. You can run all tests by selecting `allTests.cy.ts` or run a single test by selecting the test you want to run.

### Why we chose this tech stack

We chose the MERN tech stack with Apollo Client to query the API in frontend. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React and Node. The framework of the application is Vite (with TypeScript + React).

We chose MongoDB as our database and not a relational database because of MongoDBs horizontal scalability. We have almost 40 000 books, and a limited number of relations. Therefore it is more important that the database has the ability to scale well. This also means that relations have to be implemented in resolvers in the backend, as entities and relations in the database are just represented as documents.

Since we want our site to be sustainable we wanted caching in the frontend. This hinders fetching the same information from the database multiple times. This can very easily be done if you use Apollo Client to query the backends API, but then the API has to understand GraphQL. Express with ApolloServer allows us to build such an API.

MongoDB with Express is often combined with either Angular or React. We chose React because we wanted to use the [Mantine UI library](https://mantine.dev/). We wanted to use this library because we wanted to support dark-mode for our application, something Mantine helps with by supplying both light- and dark-mode versions of components. Dark-mode can lead to reduced power draw on certain types of screens and thus be more sustainable.

Mantine offers GitHub [templates](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/) for the project structure. This includes the setup with Vite, TypeScript, React, linting dependencies and testing dependencies. This makes it easier to get started with the project. We did however have to change some of the setup to fit our needs, e.g. we removed the Storybook dependency as this is not needed for our project.
