# Book Vault

_Done_

Book Vault is a web-catalogue for books. On it you can browse books of different genres, length, publishers and whatever else you would want to filter your selection by. You can leave reviews on books you have read, and view other peoples reviews to inform your next book pick.

_ToDo_

You'll have the opportunity to keep track of books you have read, and which you want to read. You will also be able to keep track of your friends literary journeys by following them.

## Pages

### Home page

### Booklist page

### Book-info page

### Testing page

This page will only be available during development of the website. It can be used to manually test different parts of the website.

**Example test made easier by this page:**

> You want to make sure new users can create reviews

> You want to look at how multiple reviews looks on a book-info page
